# Fitting 4th-order polynomial functions using a variety of constraints
# The constraint files contain constraints of various different syntactic forms to demonstrate the capabilities of PyBNF's constraint handling. 
# All constraints are consistent with the ground truth parameter values, so it should be possible to achieve a fit with a very low objective function.
