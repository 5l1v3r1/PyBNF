See paper with Kozer ... Bill, Dipak that includes MCMC

In bngl files _dose -> EGF dose, _number -> no EGF, generic identifier.

Dimer and tetramer models exist. In tetramer models, 5 extra parameters k_o factor thru chi_r factor - global across all models
p0 thru p7 transforms time -> fluorescence (?), varies by model file. p = "fraction of remaining fluorescence" 
The _do.conf only considers dimers (and generates network faster)

bng_compatible: flag to change depending on if you are using BNG or NFSim

Max tetramer enforced in generate_network. (Higher and network generation is infeasible)

3 local free parameters for each data set, and ~ 5 global parameters.
