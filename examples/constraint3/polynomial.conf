# Model specification

# This is a contrived problem featuring polynomial functions.
# I specified a bunch of crazy-looking constraints in the constraint file, which are all true for the ground truth. 
# This is not interesting from a modeling perspective, but is technically demanding enough that if we get a fit here that satisfies everything, it's a good indication the code is working.
