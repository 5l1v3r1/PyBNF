This example comes from a benchmark problem in
Gupta, A.; Mendes, P. An Overview of Network-Based and -Free Approaches for Stochastic Simulation of Biochemical Systems. Computation 2018, 6 (1), 9.

For demo fitting runs, we generated simulated data based on the ground truth parameters used in the Gupta study.

This is a fitting problem of medium difficulty which we used to compare the different algorithms provided in PyBNF. The various config files in this folder run different algorithms on the same problem using the same total number of iterations.
